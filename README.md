# Computer science mini project
An implementation of the graph ADT in order to solve a 2D path finding problem of in the Northen Sea.
The graph traverses the sea to provide routing options in order to find the shortest path between different sections of the Sea. The application also provides two search methods to traverse the graph and find a path to a location (after choosing a start and end point) using the preference selected.
